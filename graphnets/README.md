# Colab for the GraphNets tutorial at EEML 2021

**Author & Presenter**: Nikola JovanoviÄ‡

**Abstract**: 
This tutorial aims to complement the previous lecture on graph neural networks by diving deeper into some of the introduced models and applying them on practical examples. In the first part, we will obtain a deeper understanding of fundamental building blocks of GNNs such as GCN and GAT by devising their implementations from scratch, and testing them on a real-world dataset. Then, we will introduce PyTorch Geometric, a library commonly employed for graph machine learning, and use it to tackle three types of problems: node classification, graph classification and link prediction. Finally, we will briefly look at graph adversarial attacks, a selected advanced example showcasing an active research area.
